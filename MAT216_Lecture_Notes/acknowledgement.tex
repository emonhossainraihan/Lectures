\chapter*{Acknowledgement}
This series of lecture notes has been prepared to aid students who took the BRAC University
course Linear Algebra \& Fourier Analysis (MAT216) in the Summer 2024 semester. 
%I would like to thank my students Arafat and Chowdhury Zawad Al Munawar for their considerable help with a preliminary draft in \LaTeX.
The main goal of this typeset is to have an organized digital version of the notes, which is easier to share and handle. Of course, any mistakes in this text are entirely mine. I only hope to provide an easy-to-read introduction. Proofs will be omitted if the required mathematics are beyond the scope of this course. Many times only an example or an intuitive outline will be given. I am certain that some of my reasoning won't hold in a thorough mathematical review, but at least you should get an impression. If you see any mistakes or typos, please send me an email at \href{mailto:emon.hossain@bracu.ac.bd}{emon.hossain@bracu.ac.bd} with the subject: \textbf{Correction on page \# [MAT216 Lecture note]}.
